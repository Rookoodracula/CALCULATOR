## :star2: About the Project

## Defining all mathematical operations

HERE WE HAVE DEFINED MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS (+, -, *, /, **, %, //, Sqrt)

## Defining CALCULATOR Function

WE HAVE TWO INPUTS
THEN USER WILL BE ASKED TO PICK UP ANY OPERATIONS TO BE PERFORMED ON TWO INPUTS
FOR FURTHER CALCULATIONS USER WILL BE ASKED WHETHER TO CONTINUE OR NOT BY TYPING YES ('y') OR NO ('n')
IF INPUT IS YES ('y') THEN "TRUE"
OTHERWISE "FALSE"

## END
